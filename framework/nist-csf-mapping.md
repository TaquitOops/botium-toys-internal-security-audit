# NIST Cybersecurity Framework Mapping

This audit was conducted using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) as the primary security framework.

The assessment aligns with the five core NIST CSF functions:

- **Identify**: Asset inventory, risk assessment, and governance
- **Protect**: Access control, encryption, and security policies
- **Detect**: Monitoring, logging, and intrusion detection
- **Respond**: Incident response planning and communication
- **Recover**: Backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity

The framework provides a structured and risk-based approach to evaluating the organization’s cybersecurity posture.
