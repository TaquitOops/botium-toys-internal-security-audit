# Security Recommendations

- Implement the Principle of Least Privilege to ensure employees only have access to data required for their job roles.

- Enforce Separation of Duties for critical business processes to reduce the risk of fraud and human error.

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit to comply with PCI DSS and data protection requirements.

- Enforce strong password policies and require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users, especially those with access to sensitive systems.

- Deploy centralized monitoring and detection solutions, including an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), to identify malicious activity in a timely manner.

- Establish automated and redundant backup systems to protect against data loss and ransomware attacks.

- Develop and document formal Incident Response, Disaster Recovery, and Business Continuity plans to ensure operational resilience.
